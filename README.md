#Hello there! My name is Angad Bhatia. Although my one true passion in life is film, programming is a close second. I transitioned into software development at a crucial time in my life. I felt like I didn't have any true skills and had no motivation in advancing my career. Moving into software development provided me with a purpose, and it allowed me to get to my roots as a "Math Brain" type of person. It's the biggest decision in my life that I'm the most proud of, but I don't think I'll ever look back!
